## Experience

### Graduate Research Assistant | University of Vermont

- Developed and implemented predictive machine learning models to accurately predict vibrational properties of
molecular crystals 100x faster than quantum-mechanical methods, enabling real-time design feedback.
- Leveraged Python programming skills to automate routine tasks and enhance efficiency of research processes,
reducing the time to generate datasets for material property prediction by 75 %.
- Utilized HPC resources to perform complex molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry calculations,
significantly accelerating research timelines and enhancing accuracy in predicting chemical behaviors.
- Designed and implemented various hyperparameter optimization strategies to streamline data analysis processes in
advanced academic research.
- Presented results/findings at technical conferences and furnished several publications highlighting the application of
techniques to simulate material properties.
- Contributed to documentation for the Vermont Advanced Computing Core (VACC), facilitating the use of Intel's oneAPI.
- Utilized distributed training strategies to scale model training across many GPUs on clusters to rapidly train and prototype models

### Machine Learning Engineer | [Engineers for Ukraine](https://e4ua.org/)

- Designed and developed ML models to classify logos and insignias in user-uploaded images, increasing the speed at which accurate information about Russian soldiers/equipment in the area passes from local civilians on the ground to Ukrainian soldiers.

### Veteran Contributor | Lightning AI

- Served as a veteran contributor to PyTorch Lightning with 8 merged PRs deprecating functions/properties and setting up automated tests for the next release version.
- Developed a feature to allow the evaluation of gradients in inference mode, preventing the copying of tensors, resulting in a 10% increase in inference speed.

## Projects

### PyCRYSTAL23 ([Demo](https://pycrystal23-irahbptihfxaezi4c3qraj.streamlit.app/))
- Python-based webapp deployed on cloud services automating the generation of CRYSTAL23 input files for materials simulations.
- Designed and implemented an intuitive user interface and hosted PostgreSQL database, streamlining the input parameter process and enhancing user experience.
