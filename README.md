## Experience

### Graduate Research Assistant | University of Vermont

- Led research efforts in applying machine learning methods to simulate solid material properties using neural network potentials (NNPs), leading to a 100x reduction in the prediction time of desired material properties.
- Applied advanced Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) expertise to revolutionize computational chemistry, driving automated data distillation processes for efficient data handling and annotation reduction.
- Utilized distributed training strategies to scale model training across multiple GPUs on HPC clusters, allowing for rapid prototyping and reducing training time to production by 20 %.
- Presented results/findings at technical conferences and furnished several publications highlighting the application of techniques to simulate material properties.
- Created compelling and informative data visualizations to effectively communicate complex insights and trends to diverse audiences, resulting in enhanced understanding and informed decision-making.
- Designed and implemented automated methodologies to generate and process high-quality datasets from unstructured data on state-of-the-art high-performance computing resources, reducing the time to generate datasets for material property prediction by 75 %.

### Machine Learning Engineer | Engineers for Ukraine

- Implemented automated distillation techniques in computer vision workflows, reducing the need for manual data annotation and streamlining the data preprocessing pipeline.
- Designed and developed ML models to classify logos and insignias in user-uploaded images, increasing the speed at which accurate information about Russian soldiers/equipment in the area passes from local civilians on the ground to Ukrainian soldiers.

### Veteran Contributor | Lightning AI

- Served as a veteran contributor to PyTorch Lightning with 8 merged PRs deprecating functions/properties and setting up automated tests for the next release version.
- Developed a feature to allow the evaluation of gradients in inference mode, preventing the copying of tensors, resulting in a 10% increase in inference speed.
